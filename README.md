# sqstools

Tools for performing common SQS tasks.

## Installation

Get the latest binary for your platform from the [releases page], rename it, make it executable if needed, then run it
with `-h` to see usage. This is the easiest option if you don't have the Go toolchain installed.

[releases page]: https://github.com/ronny/sqstools/releases

Alternatively, if you have the Go toolchain installed, then you can get the source and build it yourself:

```sh
go get -u github.com/ronny/sqstools/.../
$GOPATH/bin/sqs-move-messages -h
```

You can omit the `$GOPATH/bin/` prefix if itâ€™s already in your `$PATH`.

## `sqs-move-messages`

Moves messages from one SQS queue to another destination (currently only supports another SQS queue). This can be used to
requeue messages from a dead letter queue back to the main queue, for example.

Example:

Move 20 messages (10 at a time) from a DLQ to the main queue:

```sh
sqs-move-messages \
  -src https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1234567890/MyDeadLetterQueue \
  -dest https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1234567890/MyMainQueue \
  -srcMaxMsgsPerRcv 10 \
  -srcIters 2
```

This uses the default AWS credentials in `~/.aws/credentials` first if any, then environment variables. Any of the
following should work:
```sh
# if you already have credentials in ~/.aws/credentials under `foo` profile
AWS_PROFILE=foo sqs-move-messages -h

# or explicitly specify credentials via environment variables
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..." AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..." sqs-move-messages -h
```

Full usage:

```
